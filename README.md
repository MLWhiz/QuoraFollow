## A Script to find out your most Followed followers:

This script does what it says. It finds out which of your followers are most followed. 

### To run this script you need to install:

1. Selenium: pip install selenium
2. brew install geckodriver (on mac)

### Things you need to change: 
- Change uname, pword parameters to log into your own account while running the script.
- Change URL to the followers_URL to get your followers.

Also note that this script is still in very adhoc condition. 

- That means you may need to change the sleep parameters based on your internet speed. 
- You may need to run the script multiple times.
